1 Introduction

In this assignment, you‚Äôre going to write a program that can hash a database of license plates and names. After reading in a Ùè∞Ñle containing plate/name pairs, your program will let the user enter a license plate, and it will display the corresponding name. The user can also enter commands instead of a license plate, in order to examine the internal data structure of your hash table.

2 Behavior

You should run /tmp/plate (you can use /tmp/database.txt as a sample database) to observe the following behaviors. Your program‚Äôs output and other behavior should match that sample program as closely as possible. Minor variations (Ùè∞ÅPLATE NOT FOUNDÙè∞Ç vs Ùè∞ÅPlate not foundÙè∞Ç for example) are Ùè∞Ñne, but any- thing other than minor cosmetic diÙè∞Éerences will cost points.

2.1 Start-up

Your executable program must be named Ùè∞ÅplateÙè∞Ç and can be run in one of two ways:

‚Ä¢ plate database_name

which will read the plate information from database_name and save it in a hash

table of size 100; or

‚Ä¢ plate database_name hash_table_size

which lets you specify the size of the hash table (must be an integer ‚â•1)

Your program should report an ERROR if it is not run in one of these two

ways (or if hash_table_size is not an integer ‚â•1) and then return(1). 2.2 Reading the database

Once the program begins, it should open the database for reading and ingest data, one line at a time. The data looks like this:

1

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<pre>PTN-673 RICHELLE MUELLER
QFJ-481 LUDIVINA WOODWARD
RRW-885 VITO HUBBARD
</pre>
and so on. Each line contains a license plate ID (no spaces, but make no other assumptions about the format), followed by a space, a Ùè∞Ñrst name, a space, a last name, and a newline (\n). If the database cannot be read, the program should report an ERROR and return(1).

2.3 User Interaction

The program then prompts the user to enter a license plate or a command. If a plate is entered, it should search the hashtable and either print the name associated with the plate, or print the message Ùè∞ÅPlate not found.Ùè∞Ç If the user enters a command, it should execute the command. In any case, the program will repeatedly prompt the user and process their commands.

2.3.1 Legal Commands

There are thee commands the user can enter: *LOAD

This will display the number of plates stored in each cell of the hash table. This is the length of the corresponding linked list (not counting the sentinel node)

*DUMP

This will display the contents of each cell of the hash table

*DUMP n

(where n is an integer) will display the contents of cell n of the hash table

(if n is not a legal, in-range integer, print an error message)

2.3.2 Output Details

Normal plate information (in response to a plate look-up) should be printed as follows:

<pre>Enter command or plate: BLD-947
First name: ELIZ
Last name: FRANKLIN
Enter the plate:
</pre>
The response to the *LOAD command should be presented as follows:

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<pre>Enter the plate: *LOAD
Entry 0: length=10
Entry 1: length=7
Entry 2: length=12
Entry 3: length=3
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="column">

</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<pre>Entry 4: length=10
Entry 5: length=10
Enter the plate:
</pre>
The *DUMP command should show the contents of a cell or cells in the following format:

<pre>Enter the plate: *DUMP 3
Contents of cell 3
Plate: &lt;AOG-380&gt;  Name: YATES, DORETTA
Plate: &lt;UVJ-347&gt;  Name: FINCH, SHELTON
Plate: &lt;MOQ-693&gt;  Name: MYERS, INDIRA
----------------------------------
Enter the plate: *DUMP 5
Contents of cell 5
----------------------------------
Enter the plate:
</pre>
2.4 Exiting

The user exits the program by entering EOF (CTRL-D at the beginning of a line). This is the only way your program should exit: it should not exit in response to errors, and it should not seg fault. Before exiting, the program should free all memory that it allocated.

3 Implementation

You will implement a pair of data structures:

‚Ä¢ a linked list, comprised of the following nodes:

<pre>struct node{
  char *plate;
  char *first;
  char *last;
  struct node *next;
</pre>
};

and including a sentinel node; and

‚Ä¢ a hash table comprised of an array of struct node* (pointers to sentinel nodes)

If you use

<pre>typedef struct node* hashEntry; // each hash entry is a sentinel node,
                               // pointing to a struct node
</pre>
3

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
then you would declare your hash table as an array of hashEntry‚Äôs, i.e.

<pre>hashEntry* hashTable
</pre>
Note that you cannot assume a pre-deÙè∞Ñne hash table size, i.e. you cannot declare hashEntry table[100]. Also note that you cannot assume pre-deÙè∞Ñned sizes of the struct node‚Äôs strings: plate, Ùè∞Ñrst and last could be 2 characters, 20 characters, or anything else. Therefore, you will be using malloc to allocate memory for the hash table, the nodes of the linked list, and the contents of those nodes.

Remember to free all malloc‚Äôd memory before exiting.

4 DETAILS

4.1 Hash Function

Use the following hash function:

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Ô£´strlen(plate)‚àí1 Ô£∂ Ô£≠Ô£∏

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
hash(plate) = Ùè∞â (i + 5) ‚àó plate[i]) i=0

</div>
<div class="column">
%hashtablesize

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
4.2 Data Structures

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
The structure for your linked list nodes is described above. Your hash table should be an array of pointers to sentinel nodes (hashtablesize of them), each initialized to point to a diÙè∞Éerent sentinel node of an empty linked list.

4.3 Required Functions

Implement the following hash functions, for use from your main program:

hashEntry *hashInit(int hashsize); // construct the initial (empty) hash table

<pre>void hashAdd(hashEntry *hashTable,
             char *plate,
</pre>
<pre>             char *first,
             char *last); // make a new entry in the hash table for this plate/name
</pre>
<pre>int hashFind(hashEntry *hashTable,
             char *plate,
</pre>
<pre>             char *first,
             char *last); // search for the given plate in the hash table
</pre>
<pre>                          // If found, load the matching first and last name
                          //    into first and last, and return 1
                          // If not found, return 0
</pre>
<pre>void hashLoad(hashEntry *hashTable); // print the load in each cell
</pre>

<pre>void listFree(struct node *sent); // release all memory associated with the list
                                  // (including the sentinel itself)
</pre>
5 SUGGESTIONS

Start early (like, today!) but don‚Äôt start coding right away. make a plan for how you will structure this. Look over the above function prototypes for the list and the hash, and think about how they will Ùè∞Ñr together. You already have linked list code from PA2, which can be modiÙè∞Ñed slightly to work here.

The hash is the main new piece of this assignment. Write a hash function. You can test it by running the sample code on the server and seeing where diÙè∞Éerent plates hashed to, and comparing to the output of your own hash func- tion. Then think about initializing the hash, and then adding entries to it. You can print the contents of the hash for debugging purposes, and compare to the *DUMP output from the sample code.

Adding to the hash is really just using the list‚Äôs add function. The only hash-related task is Ùè∞Ñnding which list to add to. Once you understand that, you should be able to search the hash in the same way: determine which list

you‚Äôre interested in, and then use the list‚Äôs search function. Same for printing the contents of a cell in the hash.

hashLoad and hashDump are diÙè∞Éerent versions of list printing: hashLoad requires you to determine the length of each list; hashDump is printing the contents of one or more hash cells.

The next piece is freeing the memory, which will take some thinking about but is really freeing each list (which you‚Äôre doing in PA2) and then freeing the array you initially malloc‚Äôd for the hash table.

The Ùè∞Ñnal piece is the main program. This is mainly a bunch of calls to hash functions, but you need to parse user input (as a plate search request or as a command), and also deal with the diÙè∞Éerent command line options, while doing error checking along the way. There‚Äôs nothing to this that you didn‚Äôt do in CSE 224, but there are a lot of details. As usual, you can start simpler (minimal options, assume no input errors, etc.) and then add complexity as you develop the program further.

Ask me questions if you are getting stuck, or aren‚Äôt sure how to proceed. Take things in small steps, start with something you know how to do, and build it up into larger pieces. And have fun!
